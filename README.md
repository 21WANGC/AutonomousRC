# AutonomousRC
Source code for the ARC organization at the University of Washington. 

##Organization
Individual projects are placed in subdirectories within the main repository.
The entry-point to communicating with the Servo Shield is the PWMController
class located in the main directory. A sample script that sends test pulses
to the motor can also be found in the main directory, run the code with:
```bash
python demo.py
```
